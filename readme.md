# Meteor & React Playground: A starter template for prototyping and playing around.

Planing to build an enterprise level prototyping stack with Meteor and React

- Theming and frontend with Postcss & Tailwindcss
- Routing and Middleware with React Router 6

for starter.

What I am trying to achive is a light framework for enterprise level prototyping

should be first of all secure, optimized, tested and logged to be at an enterprice level

## Tailwindcss & Postcss Setup

With new version, Meteor now supports postcss parsing with its own `standard-minifier-css` package.
